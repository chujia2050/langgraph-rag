However, adversarial attacks or jailbreak prompts could potentially trigger the model to output something undesired.\\nA large body of ground work on adversarial attacks is on images, and differently it operates in the continuous, high-dimensional space. Attacks for discrete data like text have been considered to be a lot more challenging, due to lack of direct gradient signals. My past post on Controllable Text Generation is quite relevant to this topic, as attacking LLMs is essentially to control the model to output a certain type of (unsafe) content.', 'language': 'en', 'source': 'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-adv-attack-llm/', 'title': \"Adversarial Attacks on LLMs | Lil'Log\"}, page_content='Effectiveness is measured by attack objective functions designed for different experiments:\\n- In text-to-image experiment, they used Q16 (Schramowski et al. 2022) and NudeNet (https://github.com/notAI-tech/NudeNet).\\n- text-to-text experiment: TOXIGEN\\nDiversity is measured by pairwise dissimilarity, in form of $\\\\sum_{(\\\\mathbf{x}_i, \\\\mathbf{x}_j) \\\\in \\\\text{All pairs}} [1 - \\\\text{sim}(\\\\mathbf{x}_i, \\\\mathbf{x}_j)]$\\nLow-toxicity is measured by Perspective API.\\n\\n\\nScoring-LIFO: Combine LIFO and Scoring strategies and force to update the last entry if the queue hasnâ€™t been updated for a long time.')]}\n",

We tested AlphaCodium on a challenging code generation dataset called CodeContests, which includes competitive programming problems from platforms such as Codeforces.

Incidentally, AlphaCodium has succeeded in significantly improving code generation performance by using generic language models (GPT, DeepSeek, etc.) without additional training and applying dedicated flows. In other words, the pre-processing phase uses natural language processing to analyze the problem, generate and select initial candidate solution codes, and prepare test cases for use in the iteration phase. This experiment evaluates the extent to which AlphaCodium improves LLM code generation performance compared to the direct prompt input method. This article introduced research on AlphaCodium, a new code generation method specifically designed for competition programming problems.\\nNow Check Your EmailTo complete Subscribe, click the confirmation link in your inbox. CodiumAI has introduced AlphaCodium, a new code generation flow meant to improve the performance of pre-trained LLMs when solving code problems without fine-tuning. Unlike approaches to code problem-solving relying on costly, time-consuming, and data-hungry training phases to achieve their results, AlphaCodium favors the development of an iterative, test-based, multi-stage flow that results in improved performance with a reduced computational footprint. AlphaCodium was tested against a code generation dataset known as CodeContests, which consists of a selection of code generation problems sourced from platforms such as Codeforces. Perhaps the most notable departure from closed-source solutions such as AlphaCode is that AlphaCodium was released with reproducible code and an evaluation script, two features enabling reliable and reproducible future comparisons.\")]}\n",
